# Alternative Hardware Solution

One reader, Jose Baars, has successfully implemented this circuit using a single integrated circuit, IRF7317, containing TWO MOSFETs (on N-channel, one P-channel).  

For details see here: https://github.com/gitpeut/IRF7317-selfextinction/blob/master/README.md  

Thanks to Jose, just shows how much we can condense this hardware when we want!
